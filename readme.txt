Traveling had slowly developed over the years, from being a simple transportation of oneÂ´s current location to deeper meanings and such. Eilers (2020) stated a list of benefits with regards to Travelling: Happiness, disconnect, meditation, discovery, boost creativity, and more.  Henceforth, with the insurgence of the pandemic and quarantines, people crave for the escape in the form of traveling; consequently, it had also propelled Travel apps to greater heights when travel restrictions are lifted. 

According to Cabrera-Howell (2016), travel applications pertain to the small widgets in smaller devices (smartphones and tablets) which makes booking and traveler far easier than before. Browsing destinations and itineraries, travels have gotten more innovative in displaying to the user what a particular place offers. With apps such as Kiwi, Tripit, and such, it makes the process of traveling more convenient than ever before.

Hence, an application is to be proposed. Entitled Trip Now!, the application would provide the user ways to view a gallery of destinations within the app and book a trip to the chosen destination. Furthermore, it will first introduce the user to the app through its Home Page, and its objectives and such through the About page. Lastly, the category of the app to be tackled will be of the Travel route.
